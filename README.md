# PowerShell Scripts by HashTag

Welcome to my PowerShell repository.

## 🔍 Purpose

This repository is designed to host and share my collection of **PowerShell scripts** developed and maintained in the context of my professional activities as a **Global IT Administrator **.

You will find here useful scripts related to:

- 💠 Microsoft 365 (Graph API, Exchange, SharePoint, etc.)
- 🔐 Azure AD and security automation
- 🛡️ Hardening & compliance
- 💻 Windows system management
- ☁️ Cloud infrastructure management (Intune, Defender, etc.)
- 📄 Report generation (HTML, CSV, JSON)
- And more...

## 📂 Structure

Scripts will be organized by category in subfolders with a clear naming convention. Each script will include:

- A short description at the top of the file  
- Usage examples  
- Required modules or permissions  
- Version and changelog if needed  

## 🚧 Work in Progress

I'm progressively uploading and documenting each script to ensure quality and consistency.  
Stay tuned – updates will be regular.
